# Haxe 3D with Heaps

This is more better than monogame so far..

Assets are expected to be in Dropbox. Easy sync and good file history.

Expected path: `$HOME/Dropbox/haxe_heaps_3d_res`

### Setup

```
./scripts/install.sh
./scripts/sync.sh
./scripts/start.sh
```

#### Run

As long as you haven't updated assets:

```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```

Once you or someone else updates the assets, you may run sync:

```bash
./scripts/sync/sh
```

Then you may start the game again!
